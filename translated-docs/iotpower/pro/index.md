IOT Power Is a fully functional, stable and reliable small hand-held power meter. It canï¼š

- Measure voltage and current of low-power devices via USB C power supply
- Used as a power supply, supporting output specified voltage
- Support current limit output, can set any current limit value
- The maximum voltage is 5V and the maximum current is 2A (the power supply needs to meet the requirementsï¼‰
- Short circuit protection, short circuit automatically limit the current to 1.5A or less
- Current **Multi-channel synchronous sampling**, no shift delay, highest resolution 0.05Î¼A
- High precision, small error, details can be found in [technical indicators](https://wiki.luatos.org/iotpower/pro/tech.html), welcome to verify
- Up to **10KHz sampling rate** to meet the power consumption test requirements of cellular modules, Bluetooth, WIFI, etc.
- You can **connect a PC client** to view and analyze the current waveform, or use the command line version to capture serial port data (such as strawberry pie) on any device (win/linux/mac) and use the pc client to import and view

IOT Power Pro Is the majority of users carry the ideal test tool.

## Upgrade compared to IoT Power V1

|      IoT Power V1       |     IoT Power Pro      |
| :---------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Software shift, shift time â‰¥ 40us | hardware shift, no shift delay  |
|    Output short circuit will burn | output short circuit automatic protection   |
|       Single STM8 Master | Air32 STM8 Dual Core     |
|   No discharge after closing the output | automatic discharge of energy after closing the output |
|      USB Serial communication | pure USB communication, low occupancy    |
|       The roller is not sensitive | The roller follows the hand and is very comfortable.   |
|      176*128 TFT Screen | 280*240 IPS Screen      |
|         UI Simple | UI fancy       |
|      Screen brightness fixed | can adjust the brightness       |
|     To use a computer to see the waveform | equipment can also see the waveform     |
|    To connect the computer to simulate the battery | the device comes with a simulated battery curve  |
