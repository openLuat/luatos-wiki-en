```{warning}
⚠Risk Alert  
Some brands of fast charging heads (such as Huawei, Xiaomi and other private protocol fast charging heads) may misrecognize the fast charging protocol, resulting in providing high voltage exceeding 5.8V to the device, resulting in instantaneous burning of the device.  
It is recommended not to use this type of charging head to connect the PC communication power interface of the device.  
PC Communication interface, it is strictly prohibited to connect positive and negative or voltage greater than 6V, reverse connection or greater than 6V will burn！
```

```{warning}
⚠Warning  
Power output interface, it is strictly prohibited to reverse other power supply/battery, or connect other power supply/battery with voltage above 5V, so as not to burn the equipment.
```

## Basic operation

### Page turning

```{note}
The progress bar below the voltage value indicates the ratio of the current voltage value to the set voltage value.  
The progress bar below the current value indicates the ratio of the current current value to the set current value.  
The progress bar below the power/power value indicates the current power consumption as a percentage of the set simulated battery power.
```
