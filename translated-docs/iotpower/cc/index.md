IOT Power CC Is a fully functional, stable and reliable small handheld high-precision power meter, it can：

- Measure voltage and current of low-power devices via USB C power supply
- Different from other USB meters, the voltage and current at the output terminal are measured to reflect the actual power consumption of the device.
- Connect **PD fast charge** charger (support PPS), decoy the specified voltage and current output
- Maximum voltage 24V, maximum current 5A
- Current **Multi-channel synchronous sampling**, no shift delay, highest resolution 0.15μA
- High precision, small error, details can be found in [technical indicators](https://openluat.github.io/luatos-wiki-en/iotpower/cc/tech.html), welcome to verify
- Up to **10KHz sampling rate** to meet the power consumption test requirements of cellular modules, Bluetooth, WIFI, etc.
- You can **connect a PC client** to view and analyze the current waveform, or use the command line version to capture serial port data (such as strawberry pie) on any device (win/linux/mac) and use the pc client to import and view
- **BOM Cost disclosure * * (pull down to have), conscientious and sincere work, sincerely recruit suppliers with more favorable prices
- Shell data is open, [open source shell address](https://cdn.openluat-luatcommunity.openluat.com/attachment/20230515082541036_%E5%A4%96%E5%A3%B3%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0.zip)

IOT Power CC Is the majority of users carry the ideal test tool.
