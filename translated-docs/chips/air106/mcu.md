# Air106 Chip

Air106 Embedded ARM CortexTM-M33 controller, the chip contains a 20MHz/40MHz clock with an accuracy of less than 1%, which can be multiplied to 160MHz clock by PLL, providing a variety of built-in FLASH/SRAM sizes to choose from, supporting ISP (in-system programming) operation and IAP (in-application programming). Peripheral serial bus includes CAN interface, 4 UART interface, SPI communication interface (support master/slave/I2S mode selection) and I2C interface (support master/slave selection). In addition, it also includes a 32-bit watchdog timer, 5 groups of 32-bit enhanced timers, 12 groups of 24-bit basic timers, 10 independent channels and 16-bit PWM generators, and 2 successive approximation ADC modules with a total of 16 channels and 12 bits and 2.5MSPS, 1 TFT-LCD LCD driver module, 1 SDIO interface, 1 image hard decoder JPEG, 1 digital-to-analog conversion DAC module, 1 RTC real-time clock and 1 external SDRAM interface control module, and provide undervoltage detection and low-voltage reset functions..
