This chapter describes how to use the i2c library for LuatOS

## Introduction

i2c Library provides communication between LuatOS and peripherals using the i2c protocol

I2C The bus is a simple, bidirectional two-wire synchronous serial bus developed by Philips. It requires only two wires to transfer information between devices connected to the bus.

## Hardware preparation

+ Air103 Development Board

+ AHT10

Air103 There is 1 channel i2c controller

AHT10 Is a temperature and humidity sensor, using I2C communication protocol, 7 i2c device address is`0x38`

Wiring Schematic

```example
         PA4/GPIO4/I2C_SDA  ------     SDA
Air103   PA1/GPIO1/I2C_SCL  ------     SCL   AHT10
         +3.3V              ------     VIN
         GND                ------     GND
```

## Software part

Interface documentation can be referred to:[i2c library](https://openluat.github.io/luatos-wiki-en/api/i2c.html)

### Initialize hardware i2c

The code is as follows

```lua
-- Air103 Hardware i2c ID
i2cId = 0
-- Initialization i2c
local setupRes = i2c.setup(i2cId, i2c.FAST)
log.info(PROJECT .. ".setup", setupRes)
if setupRes ~= i2c.FAST then
    log.error(PROJECT .. ".setup", "ERROR")
    return
end
```

The log is as follows

```log
I/user.i2c.setup 1
```

setup The return value of the function is consistent with the i2c speed at the time of initialization, which means the initialization is successful.

### Send command to AHT10 to trigger measurement and reading

According to section 5.3 in the AHT10 data manual, the trigger measurement command of AHT10 is` 0xac`. when reading temperature and humidity data, the slave machine returns a total of 6 bytes, the first byte is the slave machine status, and the last 5 bytes are temperature and humidity information. the data transmission diagram of the master machine and the slave machine is as follows

![](../img/I2C/i2c2.png)

Note that AHT10 needs time during acquisition. After the host sends out the measurement instruction `0xAC`, the converted data will be read with a delay of more than 75 milliseconds.

The read data needs to be converted by the following formula

![](../img/I2C/i2c3.png)

The code is as follows

```lua
-- AHT10 7 bit address
i2cSlaveAddr = 0x38
-- Send measurement command
i2c.send(i2cId, i2cSlaveAddr, string.char(0xac, 0x33, 0x00))
-- Wait for the measurement to complete
sys.wait(500)
-- Read temperature and humidity data
receivedData = i2c.recv(i2cId, i2cSlaveAddr, 6)
-- The separation temperature data includes the 6th bit, the 5th bit and the lower four bits of the 4th bit in the read data.
local tempBit = string.byte(receivedData, 6) + 0x100 * string.byte(receivedData, 5) + 0x10000 *
                    (string.byte(receivedData, 4) & 0x0F)
-- The separated humidity data contains the second bit, the third bit and the high four bits of the fourth bit in the read data.
local humidityBit = (string.byte(receivedData, 4) & 0xF0) + 0x100 * string.byte(receivedData, 3) + 0x10000 *
                        string.byte(receivedData, 2)
humidityBit = humidityBit >> 4
-- Converting Temperature and Humidity Results
local calcTemp = (tempBit / (2 ^ 20)) * 200 - 50
local calcHum = humidityBit / (2 ^ 20)
log.info(PROJECT .. ".Current Temperature", string.format("%.2f℃", calcTemp))
log.info(PROJECT .. ".Current humidity", string.format("%.2f%%", calcHum * 100))
```

The log is as follows

```log
I/user.i2c.Current Temperature 27.78℃
I/user.i2c.Current humidity 63.51%
```

The complete code is as follows

```lua
PROJECT = "i2c"
VERSION = "1.0.0"
sys = require("sys")

-- AHT10 7 bit address
i2cSlaveAddr = 0x38
-- Air103 Hardware i2c ID
i2cId = 0

function getAHT10Data()
    -- Send measurement command
    i2c.send(i2cId, i2cSlaveAddr, string.char(0xac, 0x33, 0x00))
    -- Wait for the measurement to complete
    sys.wait(500)
    -- Read temperature and humidity data
    receivedData = i2c.recv(i2cId, i2cSlaveAddr, 6)
    -- Separation temperature data
    local tempBit = string.byte(receivedData, 6) + 0x100 * string.byte(receivedData, 5) + 0x10000 *
                        (string.byte(receivedData, 4) & 0x0F)
    -- Separate humidity data
    local humidityBit = (string.byte(receivedData, 4) & 0xF0) + 0x100 * string.byte(receivedData, 3) + 0x10000 *
                            string.byte(receivedData, 2)
    humidityBit = humidityBit >> 4
    -- Converting Temperature and Humidity Results
    local calcTemp = (tempBit / (2 ^ 20)) * 200 - 50
    local calcHum = humidityBit / (2 ^ 20)
    log.info(PROJECT .. ".Current Temperature", string.format("%.2f℃", calcTemp))
    log.info(PROJECT .. ".Current humidity", string.format("%.2f%%", calcHum * 100))

end
sys.taskInit(function()
    -- Initialization i2c
    local setupRes = i2c.setup(i2cId, i2c.FAST)
    log.info(PROJECT .. ".setup", setupRes)
    if setupRes ~= i2c.FAST then
        log.error(PROJECT .. ".setup", "ERROR")
        i2c.close(i2cId)
        return
    end
    while true do
        getAHT10Data()
        sys.wait(5000)
    end
end)

sys.run()

```
