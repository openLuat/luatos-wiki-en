This chapter describes how to use the pwm library for LuatOS

## Introduction

Pulse width modulation (PWM), is the English "Pulse Width Modulation" abbreviation, referred to as pulse width modulation, is the use of microprocessor digital output to control the analog circuit of a very effective technology. Simply, it is the control of pulse width.

Looking up [Air105 chip data sheet_1.1.pdf](https://cdn.openluat-luatcommunity.openluat.com/attachment/20220114193313925_Air105芯片数据手册_1.1.pdf), we can see that Air105 has 8 PWM channels

We can adjust the brightness of the LED small light by pwm different duty cycle output

## Hardware preparation

+ Air105 Development Board
+ LED small lamp

Wiring Schematic

```example
        PWM5  ------  +  
Air105                     LED
        GND   ------  -
```

### Turn on pwm output

Turn on the pwm output of the PWM5 channel, set different duty cycles, the small lights will have different brightness

```lua
PROJECT = "pwm"
VERSION = "1.0.0"

sys = require("sys")

sys.taskInit(function()
    while true do
        -- Turn on pwm channel 5, set the pulse frequency to 1kHz, the frequency division accuracy to 1000, and the duty cycle to 10/1000 = 1% continuous output
        pwm.open(5, 1000, 10, 0, 1000) -- The small lamp glows slightly
        sys.wait(1000)
        -- Turn on pwm channel 5, set the pulse frequency to 1kHz, the frequency division accuracy to 1000, and the duty cycle to 500/1000 = 50% continuous output
        pwm.open(5, 1000, 500, 0, 1000) -- Small light medium brightness
        sys.wait(1000)
        -- Turn on pwm channel 5, set the pulse frequency to 1kHz, the frequency division accuracy to 1000, and the duty cycle to 1000/1000=100 continuous output
        pwm.open(5, 1000, 1000, 0, 1000) -- Small lamp with high brightness
        sys.wait(1000)
    end
end)

sys.run()


```

### Breathing light effect

The effect of breathing light is the effect that the small lamp is lit up little by little and extinguished little by little when it is never lit. We can continuously increase the duty cycle to make the small lamp light up little by little and then continuously decrease the duty cycle to make the small lamp extinguish little by little.

The code is as follows

```lua
PROJECT = "pwm"
VERSION = "1.0.0"

sys = require("sys")

sys.taskInit(function()
    while true do
        -- The duty cycle continuously improves the brightness of small lamps from 0% to 30%
        for i = 0, 300 do
            pwm.open(5, 1000, i, 0, 1000)
            sys.wait(10)
        end
        sys.wait(1000)
        -- Duty cycle continuously reduces the brightness of small lamps from 30% to 0%
        for i = 300, 0, -1 do
            pwm.open(5, 1000, i, 0, 1000)
            sys.wait(10)
        end
        sys.wait(1000)
    end
end)

sys.run()


```
