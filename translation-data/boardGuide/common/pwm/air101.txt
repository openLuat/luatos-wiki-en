本章介绍LuatOS的pwm库使用方式
This chapter describes how to use the pwm library for LuatOS
查阅[air101_芯片规格书_v1.1.pdf](https://cdn.openluat-luatcommunity.openluat.com/attachment/air101_%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E8%A7%84%E6%A0%BC%E4%B9%A6_v1.1.pdf)可知Air101共有5路PWM通道，频率范围是3Hz-160kHz，占空比最大精度为
Looking up [air101_chip specification_v1.1.pdf](https://cdn.openluat-luatcommunity.openluat.com/attachment/air101_芯片规格书_v1.1.pdf), it can be seen that Air101 has 5 PWM channels, the frequency range is 3Hz-160kHz, and the maximum accuracy of duty cycle is
打开PWM0通道的pwm输出，设置不同的占空比，小灯会有不同的亮度
Turn on the pwm output of the PWM0 channel, set different duty cycles, the small lights will have different brightness
打开pwm输出
Turn on pwm output
代码如下
The code is as follows
呼吸灯效果
Breathing light effect
呼吸灯效果就是小灯从不亮的状态一点点亮起，再一点点熄灭的效果，我们可以通过不断调高占空比让小灯一点点亮起，再不断调低占空比让小灯一点点熄灭
The effect of breathing light is the effect that the small lamp is lit up little by little and extinguished little by little when it is never lit. We can continuously increase the duty cycle to make the small lamp light up little by little and then continuously decrease the duty cycle to make the small lamp extinguish little by little.

脉冲宽度调制(PWM)，是英文“Pulse Width Modulation”的缩写，简称脉宽调制，是利用微处理器的数字输出来对模拟电路进行控制的一种非常有效的技术。简单一点，就是对脉冲宽度的控制
Pulse width modulation (PWM), is the English "Pulse Width Modulation" abbreviation, referred to as pulse width modulation, is the use of microprocessor digital output to control the analog circuit of a very effective technology. Simply, it is the control of pulse width.
