此处使用pwm方法驱动,当然也可以用gpio,spi方式,API详情查看
The pwm method is used here. Of course, gpio and spi can also be used to view API details.
的PWM输出频率

的SPI输出速率

好，我们的表白程序写好了
Well, our confession program is written.

驱动ws2812需要条件如下
The following conditions are required to drive ws2812
然后做一个简单的滚动显示函数就可以了
Then do a simple scroll display function on it
使用

是一款比较常用的外控集成LED光源，具有低电压驱动、环保节能、亮度高、散射角度大、低功率及超长寿命等优点。控制简单，应用领域极广。
It is a commonly used external control integrated LED light source, which has the advantages of low voltage drive, environmental protection and energy saving, high brightness, large scattering angle, low power and long life. The control is simple and the application field is very wide.
首先将我们要显示的换算成GBR颜色数组
First, convert what we want to display into a GBR color array.
首先看一下api说明
First look at the API description.
推荐使用pwm驱动方式，也可使用spi驱动方式，io直驱也可但实际有点勉强
recommend, pwm drive mode can be used, spi drive mode can also be used, io direct drive can also be used, but it is actually a bit reluctant
推荐使用spi驱动方式
recommend use spi drive mode
下面看看这两个函数对硬件要求
Let's take a look at the hardware requirements of these two functions.
显然，不是所有mcu都能支持的，所以LuatOS-Soc在支持gpio直驱的情况下加入了PWM和SPI驱动的方法
Obviously, not all mcu can support it, so LuatOS-Soc added PWM and SPI drive methods when gpio direct drive is supported.
显然，这要求就很低了，三种驱动方式，总有一款适合你
Obviously, this requirement is very low. Of the three driving methods, one is always suitable for you.
之后申请一个8*8的zbuff空间
After that, apply for an 8*8 zbuff space.
