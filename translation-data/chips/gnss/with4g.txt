一体化模块: 体积小, 更紧凑, 节省布线空间, 备电由主芯片控制, 主电源掉电时, GNSS芯片的备电也会掉电
Integrated module: small size, more compact, saving wiring space, standby power is controlled by the main chip, when the main power supply is powered off, the standby power of the GNSS chip will also be powered off

并无决定的好坏, 请根据自身业务选型
There is no decision, please select according to your own business.
提醒:当前尚无Air510H的模块
Reminder: There are currently no Air510H modules
搭配模块: 体积大, 需要占用更多空间, 但备电可自行控制, 生产时也可以做成选贴, 例如A型号带GNSS功能, B型号不带就不贴GNSS模组
Matching module: it is large in size and needs to take up more space, but the standby power can be controlled by itself, and it can also be made into optional pasting during production, for example, model a has GNSS function, and model B does not have GNSS module pasting without it.

本质上就是 把 GNSS芯片, 放入模块内
Essentially, you put the GNSS chip into the module.
近期有各种单北斗特性的模块, 所以以上组合也会衍生出单北斗的版本
Recently, there are various modules with single Beidou characteristics, so the above combination will also give rise to a single Beidou version.
通过GPIO,把GNSS芯片的电源控制起来
